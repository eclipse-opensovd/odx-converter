This directory must contain the XML schema (XSD) for the ODX format as specified in Annex C of ISO 22901-1:2008.

Due to licensing restrictions, this file cannot be distributed here. Users are responsible for obtaining the
schema file independently and ensuring it is named `odx_2_2_0.xsd`.

Make sure only `odx_2_2_0.xsd` (and `odx-xhtml.xsd`) are present, adding other xsd files can cause issues.
